<br/>
You can explore and download polygenic scores (PGSs) for a wide range of molecular and cellular traits in human whole blood, including proteins, metabolites and blood cell traits.

These PGSs were trained on the [INTERVAL cohort](https://www.intervalstudy.org.uk/) using the [Bayesian Ridge method](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/linear_model/plot_bayesian_ridge.html), and externally validated in other cohorts. Detailed methods and validation steps can be found in our [manuscripts](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.17.952788v1).

## Acknowledgements

Participants in the INTERVAL randomised controlled trial were recruited with the active collaboration of [NHS Blood and Transplant England](http://www.nhsbt.nhs.uk), which has supported field work and other elements of the trial. DNA extraction and genotyping was co-funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), [the NIHR BioResource](http://bioresource.nihr.ac.uk) and the NIHR [Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre at the Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust]. The academic coordinating centre for INTERVAL was supported by core funding from: NIHR Blood and Transplant Research Unit in Donor Health and Genomics (NIHR BTRU-2014-10024), UK Medical Research Council (MR/L003120/1), British Heart Foundation (SP/09/002; RG/13/13/30194; RG/18/13/33946) and the NIHR [Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre at the Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust]. A complete list of the investigators and contributors to the INTERVAL trial is provided in the [reference](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28941948). The academic coordinating centre would like to thank blood donor centre staff and blood donors for participating in the INTERVAL trial. UK Biobank data access was approved under project 7439, and all the participants gave their informed consent for health research.
